				%dt.question
					What is Blizzard Entertainment's® copyright/trademark policy for the Internet, specifically for fansites? Can I use Blizzard Entertainment's® images, text or sound on my web page? Is it ok if I use screenshots I take in-game on my web page?
				%dd.answer
					Yes, within certain limits. We asked our legal department to provide some guidelines for you, and here is what they said:
